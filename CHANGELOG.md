# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- Require Zig 0.17.0 and update CI, scaffold manifests, and container toolchains.
- Replace removed C imports with build-time header translation, migrate array
  repetition to `@splat`, and adapt reflection and standard library APIs.
- Keep borrowed byte-array SQL values alive during optimized builds.
- Forward `zig build run -- ...` arguments with `addPassthruArgs` in framework
  builds, generated apps, and the public build helper.
- Test generated apps against the current checkout with `scaffold-local-test`.

See [Zig 0.17 migration guide](docs/ja/zig-0.17-migration.md) and
[v0.1.5 release notes](docs/releases/v0.1.5.md).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Made `am.crypto.randomHex` accept runtime byte counts on native and Workers
  and removed its invalid compile-time-only formatting call.
- Preserved the complete value when binding `[N]u8`, `*[N]u8`, `[]u8`, and
  `[]const u8` through SQLite and the Workers/D1 bridge; unsupported element
  types now fail explicitly at compile time.
- Simplified CSRF token comparison to one timing-safe operation.

### Added

- Added dynamic request/Host origin verification and a custom session-hash
  verifier hook without weakening double-submit or Fetch Metadata checks.
- Documented when to use repositories, lightweight queries, preload, DTO raw
  mapping, and explicit complex business SQL.

### Testing

- Added runtime random-hex length cases, byte-array SQLite/D1 binding contract
  coverage, unsupported-bind compile failures, and CSRF hook regressions.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Added arbitrary DTO row mapping, a lightweight equality/IN/order/paging
  query builder, partial repository updates, and batch `preload.belongsTo`.
- Added model-independent `validatedJson`, numeric validation rules, portable
  crypto helpers, typed configuration metadata/loading, standard application
  error mapping, schema-agnostic session identity helpers, and idempotency
  claims.
- Added a portable storage factory, typed management-command dispatch, DB
  health checks, cookie-jar/CSRF/multipart testing helpers, and English/Japanese
  application-building guidance.

### Changed

- `akamata init` and `akamata sync` now share capability-aware Workers glue
  generation. D1, R2, Queue, and Realtime selections are detected from the
  project configuration and preserved during synchronization.
- Relation, preload, repository, and raw DTO queries share one positional row
  mapper while complex SQL remains an explicit raw-SQL escape hatch.

### Security

- CSRF protection can enforce Origin and Fetch Metadata and bind the
  double-submit token hash to the server-side session.
- Forced Workers synchronization no longer collapses projects to minimal glue;
  local modifications are still backed up, and disabled managed capabilities
  are removed only after hash verification.

### Testing

- Added D1-only, D1+R2, Queue, Realtime, and combined legacy-project sync/build
  regressions, including the `am.storage.Store` to Workers R2 path.
- Added SQLite integration coverage for DTO mapping, query construction,
  partial updates, idempotency, relation preload, and DB health checks.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Added `akamata update` to detect and update the tagged Akamata dependency,
  resolve release hashes, validate Native and Workers builds, support dry runs,
  and optionally synchronize generated framework files.
- Added `akamata sync` with a SHA-256 managed-file manifest for Workers HTTP,
  JSPI dispatch serialization, internal-route, and realtime Durable Object
  glue. New scaffolds record their generated file hashes automatically.

### Changed

- `sync-glue` is now a compatibility alias for the safer complete managed-file
  synchronization flow.
- New scaffolds pin the immutable v0.1.1 archive pending the post-release
  v0.1.2 archive hash update.

### Security

- Managed-file synchronization preflights every target before writing, refuses
  local edits by default with a diff summary, preserves forced replacements as
  `.bak` files, and never rewrites application source or `wrangler.toml`.
- Pre-manifest v0.1.0 Workers glue is migrated only when it exactly matches the
  official normalized template.

### Testing

- Added an end-to-end v0.1.0 project upgrade covering dependency updates,
  Workers serialization propagation, dry runs, local-edit refusal, forced
  backups, user-owned configuration preservation, and Native/Workers builds.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Serialized all dispatches into a shared Workers WebAssembly instance across
  the complete request/response ABI transaction. Concurrent HTTP requests or
  Queue deliveries can no longer race the JSPI-suspended `handle_fetch`,
  response pointer and length, allocator, or bridge request state.
- Coalesced concurrent first-request WebAssembly initialization and converted
  malformed WASM response status lines into an explicit `502` response instead
  of allowing the Workers `Response` constructor to throw a `RangeError`.

### Testing

- Added a 256-request concurrent Workers regression test that suspends each
  simulated WASM dispatch and verifies response isolation, allocator cleanup,
  FIFO serialization, and recovery after a rejected dispatch.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Compile-time route graphs, typed request contracts, error-to-response maps,
  capability validation, static middleware composition, static DB dispatch,
  and compile-time DI graph checks.
- Typed, versioned event protocols with TypeScript and bounded C/embedded
  metadata generation.
- Portable realtime contracts with authenticated principals, room
  authorization, presence, direct send, broadcast, sender exclusion, and
  transport-backed disconnect for Native and Durable Objects.
- Portable object storage with filesystem and R2 adapters, metadata, ETags,
  conditional requests, bounded listing, byte ranges, and download helpers.
- Portable Workers bindings and capability declarations for D1, R2, Durable
  Objects, Queues, secrets, and variables.
- Queue delivery metadata, generic identity/principal support, stream and
  outbound-network contracts, and correlated activity observability.
- Contract-aware CLI inspection, project diagnostics, API diffing, resource
  generation, database sandboxing, and a full-screen API client TUI.
- A portable `device_messaging` reference application sharing application
  contracts between Native and Workers targets.

### Changed

- Akamata now supports additive Runtime and Static/comptime API layers over the
  same `App`, `Context`, request, response, OpenAPI, and client-generation core.
- D1 statement buffers, SQLite/Turso migration behavior, native realtime
  fanout, and Workers deployment selection were hardened for production use.
- Realtime messages must pass bounded typed decoding and application handlers;
  the Workers control plane is isolated from public HTTP routes.
- The generated TypeScript realtime client uses the same flat versioned wire
  envelope as the Zig protocol.
- The product-specific Mobus example and all related deployment assets were
  removed.

### Fixed

- Streaming endpoint requests no longer hang the CLI client.
- Native realtime uses per-message allocation and invokes transports outside
  registry locks.
- Ranged downloads use exact content lengths and reject ranges over empty
  representations safely.
- Filesystem object listing uses an iterable directory handle on Linux.
- Native integration shutdown reliably wakes a blocking accept loop on Linux.

### Testing

- Added compile-fail coverage for route, input, error-map, capability, binding,
  protocol, and DI failures.
- Added Native/Workers realtime parity tests, D1 mocks, portable benchmarks,
  storage tests, embedded protocol tests, and opt-in live Cloudflare D1/R2/DO/
  WebSocket coverage.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Route registration is frozen by `App.prepare()`, the first dispatch, or `serve()`; later registration returns `error.RoutesFrozen`.
- Registration rejects duplicate/equivalent routes, ambiguous parameter shapes, duplicate parameter names, non-terminal wildcards, and more than 16 captures.
- `basePath()` returns a lightweight `Group` owned by its parent `App`.
- `HEAD` falls back to `GET` when necessary and suppresses the body. Method mismatches return `405` with a deduplicated `Allow` header.
- Forwarding headers are ignored by default. Enable `ServeOptions.trust_proxy_headers` only behind a trusted proxy.
- Every non-optional input field without a default is required by `c.input(T)`, independently of validation metadata.
- OpenAPI and client route discovery includes routes registered with the untyped helpers; `endpoint()` still attaches reflected schemas.
- Versioned migrations are transactional per file on SQLite and Turso. D1 remains non-transactional.
- The experimental reactor fails closed until it reaches production safety parity.
- Proxy headers require `trust_proxy_headers` and an explicit `trusted_proxy_fn`.
- The unfinished Zig client target returns `error.UnsupportedTarget` instead of generating runtime panics.

### Fixed

- Optional model fields preserve SQL `NULL` instead of mapping it to zero, `false`, or an empty string.
- SQL script execution respects database parsing, quoted semicolons, and comments, and rejects malformed scripts.
- Failed one-time initialization can be retried instead of leaving waiters spinning.
- Default 500 responses no longer expose internal Zig error names.
- Long static paths and trailing-slash matching now agree with indexed routes.
- Built-in session and rate-limiter allocations are released during app teardown.
- Native randomness works on Linux/musl targets.
- HTTPS trust anchors use process-lifetime storage rather than a request arena.
- Stateful middleware is App-local instead of shared by identical factories.
- Outbound HTTP rejects injection, ambiguous framing, and truncated responses.
- Job workers claim atomically and reclaim expired running leases.
- Generated TypeScript clients preserve nullable types, escape path values,
  retain HTTP error bodies, and no longer claim unknown responses are `void`.

### Added

- Explicit `Db.begin()` transactions and bounded `db.Pool` leases.
- OpenAPI operation IDs, status documentation, content types, and security schemes.

### Testing

- CI covers native unit and integration tests, task tests, CLI and example builds, Workers examples, macOS, Docker, and Linux/musl cross-compilation.

See the [English](docs/en/upgrading.md) or [Japanese](docs/ja/upgrading.md) upgrade guide.
