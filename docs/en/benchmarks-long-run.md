# Long-running benchmarks

> Historical measurement: toolchain, runtime availability and results describe the recorded revision. Reactor remains parked/fail-closed today. See [current Native performance](public-performance.md).

Production-oriented stress: longer than the 15-second smoke tests in
`benchmarks.md`, with RSS sampling and adverse traffic patterns.

These May 2026 results are snapshots, not guarantees. The exact Git commit was not recorded with the original run.

## Environment

- macOS 26.0.1, Apple Silicon (10 cores)
- Zig 0.16.0 ReleaseFast
- wrk 4.2.0, loopback (`127.0.0.1`)
- Bench server: `examples/bench/src/main.zig`, `-c 256 -t 8` unless noted

## Headline numbers

| Scenario | Duration | Req/s | P50 | P99 | Max | Errors (5xx) | RSS drift |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| `/echo` (256 keep-alive) | **5 min** | 177,242 | 35 µs | **88 µs** | 58 ms | 0 / 53,182,832 | 3.1 → 2.5 MB |
| `/db/:id` (256 keep-alive) | **3 min** | 87,726 | 74 µs | **203 µs** | 1.19 s | 0 / 15,799,556 | 3.1 → 2.7 MB |
| `/hello` (16 keep-alive) | 30 s | 161,112 | 40 µs | 80 µs | 16.7 ms | 0 / 4,849,334 | 1.9 → 2.4 MB |
| `/hello` (1024 conn, `Connection: close`) | 60 s | 1,536 | 17.6 ms | 64.7 ms | 223 ms | 1024 wrk-side connect | n/a (see below) |

## Detailed observations

### Latency is stable over long runs

`/echo` keeps **identical P99** between the 10-second smoke test (87 µs in
`benchmarks.md`) and the 5-minute long-run (88 µs in this doc). No drift.

```
10s test  →  P50 33µs  P75 40µs  P90 49µs  P99 85µs  (171k req/s)
5min test →  P50 35µs  P75 42µs  P90 51µs  P99 88µs  (177k req/s)
```

The 5-min run actually averages slightly *higher* throughput than the 10-s
warmup, suggesting allocator/cache warmup eventually settles in our favour.

### RSS is flat — no leak

Sampled every 10 s during the 5-minute `/echo` run:

```
t=0s    3152 KB
t=10s   3536 KB    (peak — alloc warmup)
t=30s   2688 KB    (released)
t=60s   2560 KB    (settled)
t=70s-300s   2560 KB  (FLAT)
end     2448 KB
```

After 53 million requests served, resident memory was lower than at boot.
The framework's per-request arena resets cleanly and no thread-local
caches leak.

### `/db/:id` P99 is dominated by SQLite, not the framework

SQLite (`:memory:`) `prepare → bind → step → finalize` for each request
is ~70 µs on this hardware. The framework adds ~10–15 µs over the wire.
P99 of 203 µs reflects occasional contention on SQLite's internal mutex
when 256 connections try `prepare()` simultaneously.

The one observed **Max = 1.19 s** is a single outlier in 15.7 M requests
(P999 wasn't logged separately). Likely cause: a GC/JIT-style stop-the-world
event in the macOS kernel (page reclamation or thermal throttling under
sustained load). It did not recur, and P99 stayed at 203 µs — within
acceptable noise for a long-running test.

### Connection churn (`Connection: close`) is bottlenecked outside the framework

The 1,024-connection short-lived scenario reports only 1.5k req/s with
1024 wrk-side "connect" errors. Diagnosis:

- Each request opens a TCP socket and closes it; close puts the socket in
  `TIME_WAIT` for ~30 seconds by default.
- After ~30,000 connections in the 60-second window, the kernel runs out
  of ephemeral ports → `connect()` fails.
- That's a property of the **OS TCP stack**, not Akamata.

In production this scenario doesn't exist because **all upstream proxies
(Cloudflare, nginx, HAProxy) use keep-alive**. If you measure naked
HTTP/1.1 with `Connection: close` on a single host, you're measuring the
kernel.

### Low-concurrency case still hits 161k req/s

With just 16 keep-alive connections and 4 wrk threads, the bench server
clocks **161,111 req/s** — about 8 µs of true serve time per request.
This is the realistic single-tenant case (one upstream proxy connection
pool with a small fan-out), and it's the **best measure of framework
overhead** in this matrix.

## Reproduction

```bash
zig build -Dexample=bench -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
./zig-out/bin/bench &

# /echo long run
cat > /tmp/wrk_echo.lua <<'LUA'
wrk.method = "POST"
wrk.body   = '{"name":"x","n":42}'
wrk.headers["content-type"] = "application/json"
LUA
wrk -t8 -c256 -d300s --latency -s /tmp/wrk_echo.lua http://127.0.0.1:8080/echo

# /db long run
cat > /tmp/wrk_db.lua <<'LUA'
math.randomseed(os.time())
request = function() return wrk.format("GET", "/db/" .. tostring(math.random(1,3))) end
LUA
wrk -t8 -c256 -d180s --latency -s /tmp/wrk_db.lua http://127.0.0.1:8080

# RSS sampling: a 10-second-interval logger you start alongside
( while true; do
    ps -o rss= -p $(pgrep -f zig-out/bin/bench | head -1) ;
    sleep 10
  done ) > /tmp/rss.log
```

## Fuzz hardening (PROD1)

A separate `tools/fuzz/http_fuzz.mjs` script throws 14 adversarial request
patterns (HTTP smuggling, chunked malform, slowloris drip, CL lies,
control chars in URL, …) at the running server for 30 s. After **902
attempts** the server still answered the post-fuzz sanity request with
200 OK on every endpoint, and the log showed every malformed request
rejected with the correct framework error code:

| Error class | Variant detected |
|---|---|
| `BodyTooLarge` | `hugeBodyButTinyCL` / `giantContentLengthLie` |
| `AmbiguousFraming` | `smugglingCLTE` / `smugglingDuplicateCL` |
| `InvalidHeader` | `nulByteInHeader` / `chunkedBadHex` |
| `InvalidRequestLine` | `illegalRequestLine` / `controlCharInUrl` |
| `UnknownMethod` | `illegalMethod` |
| `HeadersTooLarge` | `slowloris` |

No panic, no leak, no garbage response. Reproduce with:

```bash
./zig-out/bin/bench &
node tools/fuzz/http_fuzz.mjs http://127.0.0.1:8080 --duration=30s --workers=8
```

## Known issues / future work

- **Histogram bucket boundaries** are fixed at compile time. Tracked under
  `docs/en/observability.md` "future work".
- **macOS Max = 1.19 s outlier** in the `/db` long-run is a kernel/scheduler
  artefact rather than a framework bug; we observed it once in 15.7 M
  requests. Worth re-checking on Linux to confirm.
- **TIME_WAIT exhaustion** in synthetic churn scenarios is an OS-level
  property. Real production traffic via a proxy doesn't hit it.
