//! Data model for the tasks example.
//!
//! Every model is a plain Zig struct + a `__schema` declaration. The schema
//! tells Akamata how to build the SQL table, which fields to validate on
//! input, and what defaults to use. There is no separate migration DSL —
//! the struct *is* the source of truth, and `am.model.migrate` diffs it
//! against the live database on startup.
//!
//! Keep models small and serializable. If a field doesn't make sense over
//! the wire (a parsed timestamp object, an open file handle, etc.), keep it
//! off the model and compute it inside the handler.
